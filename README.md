# Content Tools

Content tools is an tool for TacZ content pack creators to automate some of the more tedious tasks of content pack creation and to eliminate human error

Currently it automates

- Folders
- Sub-Folders
- Gun index and display files
- Example en_us lang and pack.json files
- Example gun data file
- Gun sound Folders


Planned in the future is the ability to automate data files, with a GUI to choose damage, rpm, bolt or semi auto, allowed attachments, etc
