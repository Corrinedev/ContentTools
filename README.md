# Content Tools

Content tools is an tool for TacZ and VPB content pack creators to automate some of the more tedious tasks of content pack creation and to eliminate human error

Currently it automates

- Folders (VPB AND TACZ)
- Sub-Folders (VPB AND TACZ)
- Gun index and display files (TACZ)
- Example en_us lang and pack.json files (VPB AND TACZ)
- Example gun data files (VPB AND TACZ)
- Example data templates (VPB)
- Gun sound Folders (TACZ)


Planned in the future is the ability to automate data files, with a GUI to choose damage, rpm, bolt or semi auto, allowed attachments, etc

(The source code is not up to date because I didn't bother connecting it to intellij)
